      <h1>Welcome to Your Guide to Healthier Eating and Balanced Living!</h1>
    <p>
      Good health starts with smart choices, and our goal is to make it easy for you to embrace a lifestyle that supports both your body and mind. 
      Our website is dedicated to providing you with trustworthy information, practical tips, and useful tools to empower you on your health journey.
       Whether you're here to learn about nutritious food, discover balanced meal ideas, or find out how many calories you need daily, we've got everything you need to make healthy living achievable and enjoyable.</p>

  <h2>Why Healthy Food Matters for Your Body and Mind</h2>
      <p>
        Healthy food isn’t just fuel; it’s the foundation of a fulfilling life. By choosing nutrient-rich foods like fresh fruits, leafy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats, you give your body the essential building blocks it needs. These foods support energy, focus, immunity, and even mood—helping you to feel vibrant and ready for whatever the day brings.
      </p>
      <p>Our Healthy Food section is filled with resources to help you make the best choices. Discover:</p>
      <ul>
       <p> <li><b>Superfoods and Their Benefits:</b> Learn how certain foods, like berries, nuts, and greens, are packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that improve everything from skin health to brain function.</li></p>
        <p><li><b>Meal Planning Made Simple:</b> Find meal plans and shopping lists that make it easy to plan balanced meals, saving you time and reducing stress during the week.</li></p>
      <p><li><b>Healthy Swaps for Everyday Choices:</b> Small changes can have a big impact. Discover healthier swaps for your favorite foods, like switching from white bread to whole grain or choosing Greek yogurt instead of sugary snacks.</li></p>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Understanding Calories is Important</h2>
      <p>Calories are more than just a number—they’re your body’s primary energy source. By understanding how many calories you need each day, you can better manage your weight, energy levels, and overall wellness. However, it’s not just about counting calories; it’s about choosing the right calories that nourish and satisfy you. </p>

        <p>Our [<a href="CalorieCalculator.html">Calorie Calculator</a>] is designed to make calorie tracking easy and personalized:</p>
        
       <ul>
        <p><li><b>Set Your Goals:</b> Whether your goal is to maintain your current weight, lose a few pounds, or increase energy, our calculator provides daily calorie recommendations based on your unique age, gender, weight, height, and activity level.</li></p>
        <p><li><b>Understand Caloric Quality:</b> Not all calories are created equal. Our guides help you understand the difference between nutrient-dense foods, like fruits and vegetables, and empty-calorie foods, like sugary drinks and snacks, so you can make choices that work best for your body.</li></p>
        <p><li><b>Build a Balanced Plate:</b> Knowing your calorie needs helps you balance your meals and snacks throughout the day. Our Calorie Calculator provides a foundation to help you make informed choices for each meal, ensuring you’re neither overeating nor depriving yourself.</li></p>
       </ul>

       <h2>Example of a Simple, Balanced Daily Diet</h2>
       <p>Building a balanced diet is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple day of nutritious meals that keep your energy up without unnecessary calories:</p>
       <ul>
        <p><li><b>Breakfast:</b> Start with a fiber-rich bowl of oatmeal topped with fresh berries, a sprinkle of chia seeds, and a handful of nuts. This combination provides fiber, healthy fats, and natural sweetness to keep you full and energized.</li></p>
        <p><li><b>Lunch:</b> Enjoy a hearty salad with mixed greens, grilled chicken or tofu, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and a light olive oil vinaigrette. Add a slice of whole-grain bread or a quinoa side for extra fiber and complex carbohydrates.</li></p>
        <p><li><b>Snack:</b> Try a protein-packed snack like a small apple with a tablespoon of almond butter or Greek yogurt with a handful of mixed seeds. These snacks are easy to prepare and keep you fueled between meals.</li></p>
        <p><li><b>Dinner:</b> For dinner, savor a balanced plate with grilled salmon, a side of quinoa or brown rice, and steamed broccoli. This meal is rich in protein, healthy fats, and essential nutrients to support muscle repair and recovery after a long day.</li></p>
       </ul>
       <p>Eating well doesn’t have to be complicated! This example provides all the nutrients you need without overloading on calories, supporting sustained energy, focus, and overall wellness.</p>
